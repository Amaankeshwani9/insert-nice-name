# Chess

It is an attempt at a 3-Dimensional Chess. It allows the pieces of the game to move in 3-dimensions, i.e. in any of the 3 planes, we can percieve.

### Prerequisites

You'll need a Python Interpretor. You can simply install python, or anaconda.

### Description

The game features 8×8×8 moving space instead of the traditional 8×8 space. The 3-dimensions are visualized as stacking 8 of the original 2-D chess boards one on-top of the other. If the board is imagined as a cubic space, then the players are positioned at edges furthest from each other. There are 24 pieces for each player, this is due to an extra set of pawns. The extra row of pawns, is positioned a level above the original level. 

### Current Version

The Game is still incomplete. The moves of the king and queen haven't been programmed yet. Check and checkmate haven't been coded yet either.
